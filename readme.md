This is an mobile application utilizing Machine learning technologies to intelligently detect if a user is at indoor or  at outdoor based on the features like GPS signal noise, lightness, magnetic field and the number of active statellites.

Based on this powerful machien learning model, we developed three features:

 - Auto change the ringtone/internet connection method.
 - Push friendly notifications to users: 
	 - Remind uesrs to practice social distancing if the model has detected users have stayed outdoor for a long time 
	 - Remind users to do some exercise if the model has detected uses have stayed indoor for a long time 
- Provide Emergency contact service.
